# compound-wallet-risk-scoring
This project assigns credit risk scores (0â€“1000) to Ethereum wallets based on their historical interactions with the Compound V2 lending protocol. It simulates transaction features like borrow, repay, and liquidation, normalizes them, and computes a risk score using a weighted scoring model.
